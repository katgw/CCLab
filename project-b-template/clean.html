                <h3>IN OUR WORLD</h3>
                <p id="info-para"> Ocean pollution is a global crisis, with an estimated 8 million tons of plastic
                    entering the oceans annually. It poses a severe threat to marine life, ecosystems, and human health.
                    The accumulation of pollutants, including plastic debris, chemicals, and heavy metals, degrades
                    water quality, disrupts marine habitats, and contributes to the decline of fisheries worldwide.

                <p id="info-para"> Australia's marine environments, such as the Great Barrier Reef (GBR), have borne
                    the brunt of ocean pollution. The Great Barrier Reef is of the world's largest coral reef

                        litter</b> are found per square kilometer in the GBR,
                    threatening its delicate ecosystems.

                <h3>IMPACT OF POLLUTION</h3>
                <p id="info-para">
                    Ocean pollution has far-reaching consequences, causing short term harm and potential long term
                    endangerment to marine species. Plastic pollution can also be ingested by
                    marine life or entangle and suffocate them. Similarly, coral reefs suffer from pollution-induced
                    stress, which leads to coral
                    bleaching and thus a decline in the diversity and habitats fostering marine life.
