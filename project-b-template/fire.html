                <p id="info-para">
                    Rising temperatures, prolonged droughts, and changing precipitation patterns have contributed to a
                    surge in the frequency and intensity of wildfires worldwide. According to the World Meteorological
                    Organization, the annual number of weather-related disasters, including wildfires, has nearly
                    <b>tripled</b> since the 1960s. Increasing carbon emissions and global warming have played a huge
                    role in the increase of this trend globally.

                <p id="info-para">
                    Australia has a long history with bushfires but climate change has exacerbated the situation within
                    recent decades. In 2019-2020, Australia experienced a series of devastating fires, a period known as
                    "Black Summer." During this time, an estimated <b>18 million hectares of land were burned</b> ,
                    resulting in
                    the destruction of ecosystems, the loss of many animals like koalas, and devastation to local
                    communities.

                <p id="info-para">
                    As climate change amplifies fire conditions, we can anticipate longer fire seasons and more extreme
                    fire behaviour.
                    These events lead to loss of human lives, destruction of homes, and severe ecological damage that
                    cause species to become extinct or endangered.
                    During Black Summer <b>3 billion animals died</b>,
                    emphasizing the urgent need for global climate action to address the escalating risks of wildfires.

                <h3>REDUCE CARBON FOOTPRINT</h3>
                <p id="info-para">
                    Minimize your carbon footprint by using energy-efficient appliances, taking public transport, and
                    reducing overall energy consumption. Conserving energy lowers your impact on
                    climate change and decreases the carbon emissions that contribute to more intense and frequent
                    bushfires.

                <p id="info-para">
                    Practice water conservation at home by fixing leaks, using water-efficient appliances, and avoiding
                    unnecessary water usage. Drought conditions often contribute to the spread of wildfires, and
                    conserving water helps maintain environmental balance and reduce stress on ecosystems. </p>

                <p id="info-para">

                    Choose sustainably sourced and produced food products. Agriculture practices, such as deforestation
                    and large-scale monoculture, can contribute to environmental degradation and increased fire risks.
                    Supporting regenerative and sustainable farming practices promotes healthier ecosystems and reduces
                    the likelihood of wildfires.
